# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing the Bloom AI-powered farming assistant backend system. The system consists of a multi-agent architecture with four specialized agents (Main, Planner, Farm, Market) and their supporting tools, built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), FastAPI, and various external APIs including Google Earth Engine and Weather APIs.

## Glossary

- **Main_Agent**: The orchestrator agent that routes user queries to appropriate specialist agents
- **Planner_Agent**: Specialist agent for crop planning, rotation strategies, and season budgeting
- **Farm_Agent**: Specialist agent for real-time farm monitoring, crop health, and daily operations
- **Market_Agent**: Specialist agent for market intelligence, pricing analysis, and supply chain optimization
- **Earth_Engine_Tool**: Google Earth Engine integration for satellite data and NDVI analysis
- **Weather_API_Tool**: Weather API integration for forecasts and climate data
- **Web_Search_Tool**: Web search functionality for market prices and supplier information
- **Farm_Data_Tool**: Farm data access layer for retrieving farm profiles and historical data
- **ADK**: Google Agent Development Kit framework for building multi-agent systems
- **FastAPI_Backend**: Web API backend that exposes the agent system via HTTP endpoints
- **Widget_System**: Structured data format for frontend visualization components

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to interact with specialized AI agents through a unified interface, so that I can get expert advice on different aspects of farming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a query to the system, THE Main_Agent SHALL analyze the query intent and route it to the appropriate specialist agent
2. THE Main_Agent SHALL support delegation to Planner_Agent, Farm_Agent, and Market_Agent based on query classification
3. THE Main_Agent SHALL handle general queries directly without delegation when appropriate
4. THE Main_Agent SHALL synthesize responses from multiple agents for complex multi-domain queries
5. THE Main_Agent SHALL maintain session context across multiple interactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to get crop planning and seasonal advice, so that I can optimize my planting decisions and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Planner_Agent SHALL provide crop selection recommendations based on soil suitability analysis
2. WHEN requested for seasonal planning, THE Planner_Agent SHALL generate planting calendars using weather forecasts
3. THE Planner_Agent SHALL calculate budget estimates for seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs
4. THE Planner_Agent SHALL create crop rotation plans considering soil health and pest management
5. THE Planner_Agent SHALL generate profitability forecasts based on expected yields and market data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to monitor my farm's current conditions and get operational guidance, so that I can make informed daily decisions about irrigation, pest control, and harvesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Farm_Agent SHALL provide real-time crop health monitoring using satellite NDVI data
2. WHEN analyzing plot conditions, THE Farm_Agent SHALL generate irrigation recommendations based on soil moisture and weather
3. THE Farm_Agent SHALL identify potential pest and disease issues from symptom descriptions
4. THE Farm_Agent SHALL create daily and weekly task recommendations for farm operations
5. THE Farm_Agent SHALL track crop growth stages and provide harvest timing guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to access market intelligence and pricing information, so that I can optimize my selling decisions and input purchasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Market_Agent SHALL provide real-time commodity pricing for crops and agricultural inputs
2. WHEN evaluating selling opportunities, THE Market_Agent SHALL recommend optimal timing based on price trends
3. THE Market_Agent SHALL compare prices from multiple suppliers for seeds, fertilizers, and equipment
4. THE Market_Agent SHALL calculate profit and loss projections based on yields and market prices
5. THE Market_Agent SHALL track farm expenses and provide budget management insights

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate external data sources through specialized tools, so that agents can access real-world agricultural data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Earth_Engine_Tool SHALL retrieve satellite imagery and NDVI data for specified farm plots
2. THE Earth_Engine_Tool SHALL analyze soil suitability for different crop types using Earth Engine datasets
3. THE Weather_API_Tool SHALL provide weather forecasts and historical climate data for farm locations
4. THE Weather_API_Tool SHALL generate seasonal climate predictions for crop planning purposes
5. THE Web_Search_Tool SHALL search for current market prices, supplier information, and agricultural research

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to receive structured data for visualization, so that I can render appropriate widgets and charts for farmers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents generate insights, THE Widget_System SHALL create structured widget data for frontend rendering
2. THE Widget_System SHALL support multiple widget types including charts, maps, calendars, and calculators
3. THE Widget_System SHALL include all necessary data for complete widget rendering without additional API calls
4. THE Widget_System SHALL maintain consistent data format across all agent types
5. THE Widget_System SHALL store widget data in session state for retrieval after agent execution

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy and manage the backend system, so that farmers can access the service reliably through a web API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL expose HTTP endpoints for chat interactions and session management
2. THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL handle CORS configuration for frontend integration
3. THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL manage ADK sessions and maintain conversation context
4. THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
